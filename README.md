# OpenLearn

OpenLearn is aimed at lowering the barrier to entry for public/private teaching institutions to implement and teach STEM curriculum. 

OpenLearn looks to simplify the required infrastructure to enable students to quickly and easily access the content they need to learn. 

Too much time is spent with outdated hardware in computer labs which require significant time to maintain and install new hardware at the `speed of relevance` in subjects such as computer science. Not only that, but bandwidth and other issues may prevent students from accessing the content they need to learn.
